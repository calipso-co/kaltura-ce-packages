# Deploying Kaltura Clusters

Below are **RPM** based instructions for deploying Kaltura Clusters.    
Refer to the [All-In-One Kaltura Server Installation Guide](https://github.com/kaltura/platform-install-packages/blob/master/doc/install-kaltura-redhat-based.md) for more notes about deploying Kaltura in RPM supported environments.    
Refer to the [Deploying Kaltura Clusters Using Chef](https://github.com/kaltura/platform-install-packages/blob/master/doc/rpm-chef-cluster-deployment.md) for automated Chef based deployments.

### Instructions here are for a cluster with the following members:

* [Load Balancer](#apache-load-balancer)
* [NFS server](#the-nfs)
* [MySQL Database](#the-mysql-database)
* [Sphinx Indexing](#the-sphinx-indexing-server)
* [Front servers](#the-front)
* [Batch servers](#the-batch)
* [DWH server](#the-datawarehouse)
* [Streaming Server](#the-streaming-server)
* [Platform Monitoring](#platform-monitoring)
* [Backup and Restore](#backup-and-restore-practices)

### Before You Get Started Notes
* If you see a `#` at the beginning of a line, this line should be run as `root`.
* Please review the [frequently answered questions](https://github.com/kaltura/platform-install-packages/blob/master/doc/kaltura-packages-faq.md) document for general help before posting to the forums or issue queue.
* All post-install scripts accept answers-file as parameter, this can used for silent-automatic installs.
* For a cluster install, it is very important to use the answer file because otherwise, the MySQL 'kaltura' passwd is autogenerated by the installer. This is fine for a standalone server but for a cluster, passwd must be the same on all. 
* [Kaltura Inc.](http://corp.kaltura.com) also provides commercial solutions and services including pro-active platform monitoring, applications, SLA, 24/7 support and professional services. If you're looking for a commercially supported video platform  with integrations to commercial encoders, streaming servers, eCDN, DRM and more - Start a [Free Trial of the Kaltura.com Hosted Platform](http://corp.kaltura.com/free-trial) or learn more about [Kaltura' Commercial OnPrem Editionâ„¢](http://corp.kaltura.com/Deployment-Options/Kaltura-On-Prem-Edition). For existing RPM based users, Kaltura offers commercial upgrade options.

##### iptables and ports
Kaltura requires certain ports to be open for proper operation. [See the list of required open ports](https://github.com/kaltura/platform-install-packages/blob/master/doc/kaltura-required-ports.md).   

##### Disable SELinux
This is REQUIRED on all machines, currently Kaltura can't run properly with SELinux.
``` 
setenforce permissive
# To verify SELinux will not revert to enabled next restart:
# Edit /etc/selinux/config
# Set SELINUX=permissive
# Save /etc/selinux/config
```

##### Note about SSL certificates

You can run Kaltura with or without SSL (state the correct protocol and certificates during the installation).  
It is recommended that you use a properly signed certificate and avoid self-signed certificates due to limitations of various browsers in properly loading websites using self-signed certificates.    
You can generate a free valid cert using [http://cert.startcom.org/](http://cert.startcom.org/).    
To verify the validity of your certificate, you can then use [SSLShoper's SSL Check Utility](http://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html).  

Depending on your certificate, you may also need to set the following directives in `/etc/httpd/conf.d/zzzkaltura.ssl.conf`: 
```
SSLCertificateChainFile
SSLCACertificateFile
```

##### Configure your email server and MTA - REQUIRED
To achieve proper system operation and get email notifications, account activation emails, password changes, etc. all Kaltura machines in your cluster should have a functional email server. This is also ideal for monitoring purposes.   

By default Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 machines are blocked from sending email via port 25. For more information see [this thread on AWS forums](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/message.jspa?messageID=317525#317525).  
Two working solutions to the AWS EC2 email limitations are:

* Using SendGrid as your mail service ([setting up ec2 with Sendgrid and postfix](http://www.zoharbabin.com/configure-ssmtp-or-postfix-to-send-email-via-sendgrid-on-centos-6-3-ec2)).
* Using [Amazon's Simple Email Service](http://aws.amazon.com/ses/). 

### Apache Load Balancer

Load balancing is recommended to scale your front and streaming server (e.g. Red5, Wowza) machines.   
To deploy an Apache based load balancer, refer to the [Apache Load Balancer configuration file example](https://github.com/kaltura/platform-install-packages/blob/master/doc/apache_balancer.conf).   
This example config uses the `proxy_balancer_module` and `proxy_module` Apache modules to setup a simple Apache based load balancer (refer to official docs about [proxy_balancer_module](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy_balancer.html) and [proxy_module](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_proxy.html) to learn more).    
To configure the load balancer on your environment: 

1. Replace all occurances of `balancer.domain.org` with the desired hostname for the load balanacer (the main end-point your end-users will reach).
1. Replace all occurances of `node0.domain.org` with the first front machine hostname and `node1.domain.org` with the second front machine hostname.    
1. In order to add more front machines to the load balancing poll, simply clone the nodeX.domain.org lines and change to the hostnames of the new front machines.

Note that the port in the example file is 80 (standard HTTP port), feel free to change it if you're using a non-standard port.

##### SSL Offloading on a Load Balancer
Load Balancers have the ability to perform SSL offloading (aka [SSL Acceleration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSL_Acceleration)). Using SSL offloading can dramatically reduce the load on the systems by only encrypting the communications between the Load Balancer and the public network while communicating on non-encrypted http with the internal network (in Kaltura's case, between the Load Balancer and the front machines).

Kaltura recommends that you utilize offloading. I this case, you will only need to deploy the SSL certificates on your Load Balancer.    
However, if network requirements dictates (noting that this will hurt performance) Kaltura will work just as well with double encryption - But be sure to deploy the SSL certificates on the front machines as well as the load balancer.

##### Self-Balancing Components
The following server roles should not be load-balanced:

* Batch machines are very effective at scaling on themselves, by simply installing more batch servers in your cluster they will seamlessly register against the DB on their own and begin to take jobs independantly.
* Sphinx machines are balanced in the Kaltura application level.
* See below the notes regarding MySQL replication and scaling.

### The NFS server
The NFS is the shared network storage between all machines in the cluster. To learn more about NFS read [this wikipedia article about NFS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System).
```
# yum install nfs-utils-lib
# chkconfig nfs on
# service rpcbind start
# service nfs start
# mkdir -p /opt/kaltura/web
```
Edit `/etc/exports` to have the desired settings, for example:
`/opt/kaltura/web *(rw,sync,no_root_squash)`

Edit `/etc/idmapd.conf` and add your domain, for example:
`Domain = kaltura.dev`
```
# /etc/init.d/rpcidmapd restart
```

Note that you may choose different NFS settings which is fine so long as:
* the kaltura and apache user are both able to write to this volume
* the kaltura and apache user are both able create files with them as owners. i.e: do not use all_squash as an option.

Then set priviliges accordingly:
```
# groupadd -r kaltura -g7373
# useradd -M -r -u7373 -d /opt/kaltura -s /bin/bash -c "Kaltura server" -g kaltura kaltura
# groupadd -g 48 -r apache
# useradd -r -u 48 -g apache -s /sbin/nologin -d /var/www -c "Apache" apache
# usermod -a -G kaltura apache
# chown -R kaltura.apache /opt/kaltura/web
# chmod 775 /opt/kaltura/web
```

To export the volume run: `# exportfs -a`

### The MySQL Database
Please note that currently, only MySQL 5.1 is supported, we recommend using the official package supplied by the RHEL/CentOS repos which is currently 5.1.73.
```
# rpm -Uhv http://installrepo.kaltura.org/releases/kaltura-release.noarch.rpm
# yum install mysql-server kaltura-postinst 
# /opt/kaltura/bin/kaltura-mysql-settings.sh
# mysql_secure_installation
```
**Make sure to say Y** for the `mysql_secure_install` install, and follow through all the mysql install questions before continuing further.    
Failing to properly run `mysql_secure_install` will cause the kaltura mysql user to run without proper permissions to access your mysql DB.    
```
# mysql -uroot -pYOUR_DB_ROOT_PASS
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

#### MySQL Replication and Scaling
Scaling MySQL is an art on it's own. There are two aspects to it: Replication (having data live in more than one MySQL server for redundency and read scaling) and setting up read slaves.    

##### MySQL Replication 
To assist with MySQL master-slave replication, please refer to the [`kaltura-mysql-replication-config.sh` script](https://github.com/kaltura/platform-install-packages/blob/master/RPM/scripts/postinst/kaltura-mysql-replication-config.sh).    
To run the replication configuration script, note the following:

* The MySQL server you've installed during the Kaltura setup is your master. 
* After completing the Kaltura setup, simply run `kaltura-mysql-replication-config.sh dbuser dbpass master_db_ip master` from the master machine
* Follow the same instructions above to install every slave machine, and run the following command: `kaltura-mysql-replication-config.sh dbuser dbpass master_db_ip slave`

To read more and learn about MySQL Master-Slave configuration, refer to the official MySQL documentation:  

* [Setting the Replication Master Configuration](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/replication-howto-masterbaseconfig.html)
* [Setting the Replication Slave Configuration](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/replication-howto-slavebaseconfig.html)

##### MySQL Read Scaling 
After configuring your environment MySQL replication, in order to distribute the READ load, you can also configure Kaltura to 'load-balance' MySQL reads between the master and 2 additional slave machines.    
Note that you can only have one machine for writes - this is your master.    
Follow these steps to 'load-balance' READ operations between the MySQL servers:  

* Edit `/opt/kaltura/app/configurations/db.ini`
* Find the following section, this is your MASTER (replace the upper case tokens with real values from your network hosts):

```
propel.connection.hostspec = MASTER_DB_HOST
propel.connection.user = kaltura
propel.connection.password = KALTURA_DB_USER_PASSWORD
propel.connection.dsn = "mysql:host=MASTER_DB_HOST;port=3306;dbname=kaltura;"
```

* The sections that will follow will look the same, but after the key `propel`, you'll notice the numbers 2 and 3. These are the second and third MySQL servers that will be used as SLAVES (replace the upper case tokens with real values from your network hosts):

```
propel2.connection.hostspec = SECOND_DB_HOST
propel2.connection.user = kaltura
propel2.connection.password = KALTURA_DB_USER_PASSWORD
propel2.connection.dsn = "mysql:host=SECOND_DB_HOST;port=3306;dbname=kaltura;"

propel3.connection.hostspec = THIRD_DB_HOST
propel3.connection.user = kaltura
propel3.connection.password = KALTURA_DB_USER_PASSWORD
propel3.connection.dsn = "mysql:host=THIRD_DB_HOST;port=3306;dbname=kaltura;"
```

### The Sphinx Indexing Server
```
# rpm -Uhv http://installrepo.kaltura.org/releases/kaltura-release.noarch.rpm
# yum install kaltura-sphinx
# /opt/kaltura/bin/kaltura-sphinx-config.sh
```
It is recommended that Sphinx will be installed on its own dedicated machine. However, if needed, Sphinx can be coupled with a front machine in low-resources clusters.

After installing the first cluster node, obtain the auto generated file placed under /tmp/kaltura_*.ans, replace relevant values and use it for the installation of the remaining nodes.

### The first Front node
Front in Kaltura represents the machines hosting the user-facing components, including the Kaltura API, the KMC and Admin Console, MediaSpace and all client-side widgets. 
```
# rpm -Uhv http://installrepo.kaltura.org/releases/kaltura-release.noarch.rpm
# yum install kaltura-postinst
# /opt/kaltura/bin/kaltura-nfs-client-config.sh
# yum install kaltura-front kaltura-widgets kaltura-html5lib kaltura-html5-studio 
# /opt/kaltura/bin/kaltura-front-config.sh
# /opt/kaltura/bin/kaltura-db-config.sh
```
**NOTE: /opt/kaltura/bin/kaltura-db-config.sh and kaltura-widgets kaltura-html5lib kaltura-html5-studio which are installed on the web mount only need to run on the first node.**

### Secondary Front nodes
Front in Kaltura represents the machines hosting the user-facing components, including the Kaltura API, the KMC and Admin Console, MediaSpace and all client-side widgets. 
```
# rpm -Uhv http://installrepo.kaltura.org/releases/kaltura-release.noarch.rpm
# yum install kaltura-postinst
# /opt/kaltura/bin/kaltura-nfs-client-config.sh
# yum install kaltura-front
# /opt/kaltura/bin/kaltura-front-config.sh
```

### The Batch
Batch in Kaltura represents the machines running all async operations. To learn more, read: [Introduction to Kaltura Batch Processes](http://knowledge.kaltura.com/node/230).
```
# rpm -Uhv http://installrepo.kaltura.org/releases/kaltura-release.noarch.rpm
# yum install kaltura-postinst
# /opt/kaltura/bin/kaltura-nfs-client-config.sh
# yum install kaltura-batch
# /opt/kaltura/bin/kaltura-batch-config.sh
```

#### Note about batch scaling
Adding more batch machines is simple and easy! Due to the distributed architecture of batches in Kaltura, batches are independantly registering themselves against the Kaltura cluster, and independantly assume jobs from the queue.   
In order to scale your system batch capacity, simply install new bacth machines in the cluster.   
When running the `kaltura-batch-config.sh` installer on the batch machine, the installer replaces the config tokens and sets a uniq ID per batch. Then seamlessly, the batch registers against the DB and starts taking available jobs.

### The DataWarehouse
The DWH is Kaltura's Analytics server.
```
# rpm -Uhv http://installrepo.kaltura.org/releases/kaltura-release.noarch.rpm
# yum install kaltura-dwh kaltura-postinst
# /opt/kaltura/bin/kaltura-nfs-client-config.sh
# /opt/kaltura/bin/kaltura-dwh-config.sh
```

### The Streaming Server
To achieve RTMP/t/e playback, Live streaming, webcam recording, and etc. Kaltura requires a streaming server.   
You can use the open source Red5 server which is available as a Kaltura package too, and follow the steps below.   

To install Red5:
```
# rpm -Uhv http://installrepo.kaltura.org/releases/kaltura-release.noarch.rpm
# yum install kaltura-red5 kaltura-postinst
```

* Visit on your browser: `http://your_red5_server_hostname:5080` (This will load Red5's Web Admin)
* Click 'Install a ready-made application'
* Check 'OFLA Demo' and click 'Install'
* Edit `/usr/lib/red5/webapps/oflaDemo/index.html` and replace `localhost` with your actual Red5 hostname or IP
* Test OflaDemo by visiting `http://your_red5_server_hostname:5080/oflaDemo/` and playing the sample videos
* Run: `# /opt/kaltura/bin/kaltura-red5-config.sh`

Kaltura supports commercial encoders and streaming servers too. For more information about commercial alternatives see [Kaltura Commercial OnPrem Editionâ„¢](http://corp.kaltura.com/Deployment-Options/Kaltura-On-Prem-Edition).

### Platform Monitoring
Please refer to the [Setting up Kaltura platform monitoring guide](https://github.com/kaltura/platform-install-packages/blob/master/doc/platform-monitors.md).

### Backup and Restore Practices
Backup and restore is quite simple. Make sure that the following is being regularly backed up:

* MySQL dump all Kaltura DBs (`kaltura`, `kaltura_sphinx_log`, `kalturadw`, `kalturadw_bisources`, `kalturadw_ds`, `kalturalog`). You can use the following `mysqldump` command:
`# mysqldump -h$DBHOST -u$DBUSER -p$DBPASSWD -P$DBPORT --routines --single-transaction $TABLE_SCHEMA $TABLE | gzip > $OUT/$TABLE_SCHEMA.$TABLE.sql.gz`
* The `/opt/kaltura/web` directory, which includes all of the platform generated and media files.
* The `/opt/kaltura/app/configurations` directory, which includes all of the platform configuration files.

Then, if needed, to restore the Kaltura server, follow these steps:

* Install the **same version** of Kaltura on a clean machine
* Stop all services
* Copy over the web and configurations directories
* Import the MySQL dump
* Restart all services
* Reindex Sphinx with the following commands: 

```
# rm -f /opt/kaltura/log/sphinx/data/*
# cd /opt/kaltura/app/deployment/base/scripts/
# for i in populateSphinx*;do php $i >/tmp/$.log;done
```
