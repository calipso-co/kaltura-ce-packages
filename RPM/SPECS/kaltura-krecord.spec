%changelog
* Wed Feb 3 2016 Jess Portnoy <jess.portnoy@kaltura.com> - v1.7.1-1
- https://github.com/kaltura/krecord/releases/tag/v1.7.1

* Mon Feb 3 2014 Jess Portnoy <jess.portnoy@kaltura.com> - v1.7.0-2
- Since these widgets typically reside on NFS and served from another machine there is not need for the Apache dep.

* Sat Feb 1 2014 Jess Portnoy <jess.portnoy@kaltura.com> - v1.7.0-1
- Publish Live Streams
  Use the following flashvars to publish live streams:
	isLive: "true"
	rtmpHost : address of a server that holds the app that handles publishing live streams (can be retrieved by parsing KalturaLiveStreamEntry.primaryBroadcastingUrl)
	fmsApp: name of the application that will handle live streaming (can be retrieved by parsing KalturaLiveStreamEntry.primaryBroadcastingUrl)
	streamName: name of the published stream (KalturaLiveStreamEntry.streamName)

- NOTE: KRecord GUI doesn't support live streaming gracefully. This feature is planned to be used without UI (via JS API).
- KRecord GUI doesn't stop you from publishing a live stream, but it doesn't hide irrelevant features like preview of published stream after publish is done.

* Sun Jan 12 2014 Jess Portnoy <jess.portnoy@kaltura.com> - 1.0.0-1
- initial package.
