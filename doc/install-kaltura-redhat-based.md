## Non-SSL Step-by-step Installation

### Pre-Install notes
* This install guides assumes that you did a clean, basic install of one of the RHEL based OS's in 64bit architecture.
* When installing, you will be prompted for each server's resolvable hostname. Note that it is crucial that all host names will be resolvable by other servers in the cluster (and outside the cluster for front machines). Before installing, verify that your /etc/hosts file is properly configured and that all Kaltura server hostnames are resolvable in your network.
* Before you begin, make sure you're logged in as the system root. Root access is required to install Kaltura, and you should execute ```sudo -i``` or ```su -```to make sure that you are indeed root.

#### Firewall requirements
Kaltura requires certain ports to be open for proper operation. [See the list of required open ports](https://github.com/kaltura/platform-install-packages/blob/master/doc/kaltura-required-ports.md).
If you're just testing and don't mind an open system, you can use the below to disbale iptables altogether:
```bash
iptables -F
service iptables stop
chkconfig iptables off
```
#### Disable SELinux - REQUIRED
**Currently Kaltura doesn't properly support running with SELinux, things will break if you don't set it to permissive**.

```bash
setenforce permissive
```

To verify SELinux will not revert to enabled next restart:

1. Edit the file `/etc/selinux/config`
1. Verify or change the value of SELINUX to permissive: `SELINUX=permissive`
1. Save the file `/etc/selinux/config`

### Start of Kaltura installation
This section is a step-by-step guide of a Kaltura installation without SSL.

#### Setup the Kaltura RPM repository

```bash
rpm -ihv http://installrepo.kaltura.org/releases/kaltura-release.noarch.rpm
```

## Note on RHEL/CentOS 7 
If you are using RHEL/CentOS 7, edit /etc/yum.repos.d/kaltura.repo and change the ```[Kaltura]``` section:
```
baseurl = http://installrepo.kaltura.org/releases/latest/RPMS/$basearch/
```
to read:
```
baseurl = http://installrepo.kaltura.org/releases/rhel7/RPMS/$basearch/
```

The ```[Kaltura-noarch]``` repo should remain as is. 

*Note for RHEL7: depending on what repos you have enabled, you may also need to add the EPEL or CentOS repos to resolve all dependencies.*

#### Enabling the EPEL repo
To add the EPEL repo:
```
# rpm -ihv https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
```
For CentOS/RHEL6, this should not be necessary, for RHEL/CentOS 7, you will need EPEL for the mediainfo package.


#### MySQL Install and Configuration
For MySQL versions higher 5.5 and above, note that you must disable strict mode for the deployment to succeed.
Please see the following document:
https://support.realtyna.com/index.php?/Knowledgebase/Article/View/535/0/how-can-i-turn-off-mysql-strict-mode

RHEL/CentOS 6 setup:
```bash
yum install mysql mysql-server
service mysqld start
mysql_secure_installation
chkconfig mysqld on
```

RHEL/CentOS 7 setup:
```bash
yum install mariadb-server
service mariadb start
mysql_secure_installation
chkconfig mariadb on
```

**Make sure to answer YES for all steps in the `mysql_secure_install` install, and follow through all the mysql install questions before continuing further.
Failing to properly run `mysql_secure_install` will cause the kaltura mysql user to run without proper permissions to access your mysql DB, and require you to start over again.

#### Mail Server (MTA) Install and Configuration
If your machine doesn't have postfix email configured before the Kaltura install, you will not receive emails from the install system nor publisher account activation mails.
If postfix runs without further configuration starting it is sufficient to make Kaltura work.
```bash
service postfix restart
```

If you are using Amazon Web Services (AWS) please note that by default EC2 machines are blocked from sending email via port 25. For more information see [this thread on AWS forums](https://forums.aws.amazon.com/message.jspa?messageID=317525#317525).

##### Note regarding desktop installations

When installing on a "desktop" environment there may be package conflicts with media encoding/decoding plugins.

In Redhat 6.5 you should run the following to remove the conflicting packages:
`rpm -e gstreamer-plugins-bad-free totem totem-nautilus`

#### Install Kaltura Server

Install the basic Kaltura Packages:
```bash
yum clean all
yum install kaltura-server
```

Configure MySQL with the required Kaltura Settings
```bash
/opt/kaltura/bin/kaltura-mysql-settings.sh
```

Start required service and configure them to run at boot:
```bash
service memcached restart
service ntpd restart
chkconfig memcached on
chkconfig ntpd on
```

### Start of Kaltura Configuration
```bash
/opt/kaltura/bin/kaltura-config-all.sh
```

The below is a sample question answer format, replace the input marked by <> with your own details:

```bash
[Email\NO]: "<your email address>"
CDN hostname [kalrpm.lcl]: "<your hostname>"

Your time zone [see http://php.net/date.timezone], or press enter for [Europe/Amsterdam]: "<your timezone>"
How would you like to name your system (this name will show as the From field in emails sent by the system) [Kaltura Video Platform]? "<your preferred system name>"
Your website Contact Us URL [http://corp.kaltura.com/company/contact-us]: "<your contact URL>"
'Contact us' phone number [+1 800 871 5224]? "<your phone numer>"

Is your Apache working with SSL?[Y/n] "<n>"
It is recommended that you do work using HTTPs. Would you like to continue anyway?[N/y] "<y>"
Which port will this Vhost listen on? [80] "<80>"
Please select one of the following options [0]: "<0>"
```

Your install will now automatically perform all install tasks.

#### Configure Red5 server
1. install the kaltura-red5 package:
```
# yum install kaltura-red5
```
1. Request http://hostname:5080
1. Click 'Install a ready-made application'
1. Mark 'OFLA Demo' and click 'Install'
1. Edit /usr/lib/red5/webapps/oflaDemo/index.html and replace 'localhost' with your actual Red5 hostname or IP
1. Test OflaDemo by making a request to http://hostname:5080/oflaDemo/ and playing the sample videos
1. Run:

```bash
/opt/kaltura/bin/kaltura-red5-config.sh
```



**Your Kaltura installation is now complete.**

## SSL Step-by-step Installation
### Pre-Install notes
* This install guides assumes that you did a clean, basic install of one of the support RHEL based OS's in 64bit architecture.
* Currently, the Nginx VOD module does not support integration with Kaltura over HTTPs, only HTTP is supported. 
* When installing, you will be prompted for each server's resolvable hostname. Note that it is crucial that all host names will be resolvable by other servers in the cluster (and outside the cluster for front machines). Before installing, verify that your /etc/hosts file is properly configured and that all Kaltura server hostnames are resolvable in your network.
* Before you begin, make sure you're logged in as the system root. Root access is required to install Kaltura, and you should execute ```sudo -i``` or ```su -``` to make sure that you are indeed root.
* It is recommended that you use a properly signed certificate and avoid self-signed certificates due to limitations of various browsers in properly loading websites using self-signed certificates.
  * You can generate a free valid cert using [http://cert.startcom.org/](http://cert.startcom.org/).
  * To verify the validity of your certificate, you can then use [SSLShoper's SSL Check Utility](http://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html).

Your install will now automatically perform all install tasks.

#### Configure Red5 server
1. Request http://hostname:5080
1. Click 'Install a ready-made application'
1. Mark 'OFLA Demo' and click 'Install'
1. Edit /usr/lib/red5/webapps/oflaDemo/index.html and replace 'localhost' with your actual Red5 hostname or IP
1. Test OflaDemo by making a request to http://hostname:5080/oflaDemo/ and playing the sample videos
1. Run:

```bash
/opt/kaltura/bin/kaltura-red5-config.sh
```

## Note about using Wowza as media server
you can use Wowza as media server instead of Red5. For webcam recording using Wowza, please follow:
https://github.com/kaltura/media-server/blob/3.0.9/Installation.md#for-webcam-recording-servers
And then run /opt/kaltura/bin/kaltura-red5-config.sh providing the Wowza IP/hostname.

### SSL Certificate Configuration

Set the following directives in `/etc/httpd/conf.d/zzzkaltura.ssl.conf`:
```
SSLCertificateChainFile
SSLCACertificateFile
```

To use the [monit](http://mmonit.com/monit/) Monitoring tab in admin console, you will need to also configure the SSL certificate for monit.
To use the same certificate as you used for Kaltura they will need to be in PEM format. If it is not see [Generate PEM Instructions](http://www.digicert.com/ssl-support/pem-ssl-creation.htm)

Edit: `/opt/kaltura/app/configurations/monit/monit.conf` and add:
```
SSL ENABLE
PEMFILE /path/to/your/certificate.pem
```

Finally, run: ```/etc/init.d/kaltura-monit restart```

**Your Kaltura installation is now complete.**

## Unattended Installation
All Kaltura scripts accept an answer file as their first argument.
In order to preform an unattended [silent] install, simply edit the [template](https://github.com/kaltura/platform-install-packages/blob/master/doc/kaltura.template.ans) and pass it along to kaltura-config-all.sh.

## Upgrade Kaltura
*This will only work if the initial install was using this packages based install, it will not work for old Kaltura deployments using the PHP installers*
```bash
yum clean all
yum update kaltura-release
yum clean all
yum update "*kaltura*"
```
Then follow the on-screen instructions (in case any further actions required).
Once the upgrade completes, please run:
```bash
/opt/kaltura/bin/kaltura-config-all.sh
```

In the event you would like to see what changes the package includes before deciding whether or not you wish to upgrade, run:
```bash
yum install yum-plugin-changelog
yum changelog all kaltura-package-name-here
```

To upgrade your DB schema.

## Remove Kaltura
Use this in cases where you want to clear the database and start from fresh.
```bash
/opt/kaltura/bin/kaltura-drop-db.sh
yum remove "*kaltura*"
rm -rf /opt/kaltura
```

## Troubleshooting
Once the configuration phase is done, you may wish to run the sanity tests, for that, run:
```base
/opt/kaltura/bin/kaltura-sanity.sh
```

If you experience unknown, unwanted or erroneous behaviour, the logs are a greta place to start, to get a quick view into errors and warning run:
```bash
kaltlog
```

If this does not give enough information, increase logging verbosity:
```bash
sed -i 's@^writers.\(.*\).filters.priority.priority\s*=\s*7@writers.\1.filters.priority.priority=4@g' /opt/kaltura/app/configurations/logger.ini
```

To revert this logging verbosity run:
```bash
sed -i 's@^writers.\(.*\).filters.priority.priority\s*=\s*4@writers.\1.filters.priority.priority=7@g' /opt/kaltura/app/configurations/logger.ini
```

Or output all logged information to a file for analysis:
```bash
allkaltlog > /path/to/mylogfile.log
```
